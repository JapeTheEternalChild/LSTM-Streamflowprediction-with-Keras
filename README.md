# LSTM-Streamflowprediction-with-Keras

## This code was created to reproduce the results published in this paper:

https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/22/6005/2018/

https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6005-2018

corresponding GitHub repository:

https://github.com/kratzert/AGU2018/tree/master/code
--> repository includes code examples which models differ from the Paper (different hyperparameter settings and different deep learning framework) 


## The used CAMELS Dataset can be assesed under:

https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels

## Requirements
It is advised to use a Colab notebook to run the code
https://colab.research.google.com/

Colab can load data from a google drive. Load CAMELS dataset into the drive.

## How to run the code

the code is split into 5 differnt files.

The first 3 correspond to the different Experiments. The other 2 are for analysing and visualizing the results.
